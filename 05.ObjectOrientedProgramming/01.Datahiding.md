**Datahiding**

Outside person cant access our internal data directly or our internal data should not go out directly this oop feature is nothing but data hiding.

After validation or authentication outside person can access our internal data.

example : after providing proper username and password we are able to access gmail information

example : Even though we are valid customer of the bank we can able to access our account information and we cant access others account information.

By declaring data member (variable) as private we can acheive data hiding


```java

public class Accout{
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance(){
        //validation
        return balance
    }
}
```

The main advantage of data hiding is security. It is highly recommended to declare data member (variable) as private
