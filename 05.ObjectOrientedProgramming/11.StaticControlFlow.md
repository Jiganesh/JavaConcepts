**Static Control Flow**


Whenever we are executing a java class the following sequence of steps will be executed as part of static control flow



1. Identification of static members from top to bottom
2. Execution of static variable assignments and static ==blocks== (not methods) from top to bottom
3. Execution of main method



```java


class Base {
    static int i = 10; // 1 , 7

    static { //2
        m1();  // 8
        System.out.println("First Static Block"); //10
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){ //3 
        m1(); //13
        System.out.println("Main Method");      //15   
    }

    public static void m1(){ //4 
        System.out.println( "J:" , j);//9 ,14
    }

    static { //5 
        System.out.println("Second Static Block"); //11
    }

    static int j = 20; //6 //12
}
```
Output : 
```

J: 0
First Static Block
Second Static Block
J: 20
Main Method

```


Inside a static block if we are trying to read a variable that read operation is called direct read.

If we are calling a method and within that method we are trying to read a variable then that read operation is called indirect read.

If a variable is just identified by JVM and original value not yet assigned then then variable is said to be in "read indirectly and write only state" - RIWO


If a variable is in RIWO state then we cant perform direct read but we can perform indirect read. If we are trying to read directly we will get CE : illegal forward reference



Examples


```java


class Test {

    static int x = 10;

    static {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

```
