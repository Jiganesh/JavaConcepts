**Singleton**


Singleton classes - For any java class if we are allowed to create only one object such type of class is called singleton class .


example Runtime, BusinessDelegate, ServiceLocator



Advantage of singleton class 👍

If several people have same requirement then it is not recommended to create a separate object for every requirement. We have to create only one object and we can reuse the same object for every similar requirement so that performance and memory utilizations will be improved.

This is the central idea of singleton classes



```
Runtime r1 = Runtime.getRuntime();

Runtime r2 = Runtime.getRuntime();
.
.
.
.

Runtime r100 = Runtime.getRuntime();




r1


r2

.  --------> all point to only one object
.
.
.

r100
```


We can create our own singleton classes, for this we have to use private constructor and private static variable and public factory method


Approach 1 : 

```java


class Test {
    private static Test t = new Test();

    private Test(){

    }

    public static Test getTest(){
        return t;
    }
}

```


Note : Runtime class is internally implemented by using this approach.

```java

class Test {
    private static Test t = null

    private Test(){

    }

    public static Test getTest(){
        if (t == null){
            t = new Test();
        }
        return t;
    }
}

```

At any point of time for Test class we can create only one object hence test class is singleton class.


class is not final but we are not allowed to create child classes how it is possible


By declaring every constructor as private we can restrict child class creation for C it is impossible to create child class.

```
class P {
    private P(){

    }
}

class C extends P {

}

```


```

CE : P() has private access in P
```
