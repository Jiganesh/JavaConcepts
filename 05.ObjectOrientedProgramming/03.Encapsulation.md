**Encapsulation**

The process of binding data and corresponding methods into a single unit is nothing but encapsulation.

example 👍

```java
class Student {

    String name;
    int age;

    public int getMarks(){

    }

    public String getRemarks(){

    }
}

```

If any component follows data hiding and abstraction such type of component is set to be encapsulated component.

> Encapsulation = Data hiding + Abstraction




```java

public class Account {

    private double balance 


    public double getBalanace(){
        //validation  - datahiding
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(){
        //validation  - datahiding
        this.balance = balance
    }
}

```


Abstraction to end customer via GUI

```
        BANK GUI SCREEN

        Check Balance
        Update Balance

```


The main advantages of encapsulation are we can acheive security enchancement will become easy it improves maintainablity of application but main disadvantage of encapsulation is it increases length of the code and slows down execution




**Tightly Encapsulation class**

A class is said to be tightly encapsulated if and only if each and every variable declared as private whether class contains corresponding getter and setter methods or not and whether these methods are declared as public or not. These things we are not required to check.


```java

public class Account{
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance(){
        return balance;
    }
}

```


which of the following classes are tightly encapsulated ?

```java

class A {
    private int x = 10;
}

class B extends A {
    int y = 10;
}
class C extends A {
    private int z = 30;
}

```

Class A and C are tightly encapsulated

```java

class A {
    int x = 10;
}

class B extends A{

}

class C extends B {
    private int z = 30;
}
```

No class is tightly encapsulated

If the parent class is not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly encapsulated.
