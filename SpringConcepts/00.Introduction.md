Earlier it was called interface 21 then it was called spring.

Spring came as alternation to EJB - Makes application lightweight.

---

If we have dependency on a platform then they are heavyweight.



AWT - dependency of OS libraries (HeavyWeight)
Swings - dependency of JDK libraries and not OS Libraries (Lightweight)
EJB - dependency of Application Server (HeavyWeight)
Spring - no dependency of Application Server just jdk -> spring jar (LightWeight)
