**Overridding**

Whetever methods parent had by default available to child through inheritance if child class not satisfied with parent class implementation then child is allowed to redefine that method bases on this requirement this process is called overridding. 

The parent class method which is overridden is called overridden method and child class method which is overridding is called overridding method.

```java

class P {

    public void property (){
        System.out.println("Cash + Land + Gold");
    }

    // overridden method
    public void marry (){
        System.out.println("Tanaya");
    }
}

class C extends P {

    //overridding method
    public void marry(){
        System.out.println("Radha");
    }
}

```



```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        P p = new P ()
        p.marry(); // parent method


        C c = new C ();
        c.marry();  // child method

        P p1 = new C ();
        p1.marry(); // child method
    }
}

```

In overridding method resollution is always take care by JVM based on runtime object and hence overridding also considered as runtime polymorphism or late binding.


Rules for overridding


1. In overridding method name and argument types must be matched that is method signature must be same.

2. In overridding return type must be same but this rule is applicable until 1.4 version only from 1.5 version onwards we can take co-varient return types according to this child class method return type need not be same as parent method return type - its child type also allowed.


```java

class P {

   public Object m1(){
    return null;
   }
}

class C extends P {

    // Covarient return type means String is covarient return type of Object as it is its child
    public String m1(){
        return null;
    }
}

```

Parent class  -> Child class

Object -> Object | String | StringBuffer

Number -> Number | Integer

String -> Object (invalid)

double -> int (invalid)

Covarient return type concept applicable only for object types but not for primitive types.




3. Parent class private methods not available to child and hence overridding concepts not applicable for private methods. Bases on our requirement exactly same private method in child class - it is valid but not overridding


```java

class P{
    private void m1(){
    }
}

class C extends P{
    private void m1(){ // not overridding

    }
}

```


4. We cant override parent class final methods in child classes if we are trying to override we will get compile time error

```java

class P{
    public final void m1(){


    }
}

class C extends P{

    public void m1(){

        // CE : m1() in C cannot override m1() in P overriddent method is final
    }
}

```

5. Parent class abstract methods we hsould override in child class to provide implementation 


```java


abstract class P{
    public abstract void m1();
}


class C extends P{
    public void m1(){
        
    }
}
```




6.  We can override non abstract method as abstract. The main advantage of this approach is we can stop the availablity of parent method implementation to next level child classes.

```java
class P {
    public void m1(){

    }
}

abstract class C extends P {

    public abstract void m1();
}
```


In overridding the following modifiers wont keep any restriction - synchronized, native, strictfp

Parent method  -> Child method


final -> non-final / final (invalid)
nonfinal -> final
abstract <-> non-abstract
sychronized | native | strictfp <--> non-sychronized | non- native | non-strictfp




7. While overridding we cant reduce the scope of access modifier but we can increase the scope.

```java


class P {
    public void m1(){

    }
}


class C extends P {
    void m1(){
        // CE: m1() in C cannot override m1() in P ; attemepting to assign weaker access privilages ; was public.
    }
}
```


> private < default < protected < public


```

parent class method -> Child class method


public -> public

protected -> protected | public

default -> default | protected | public

private -> overridding concept not applicable for private methods


```




8. If a child class method throws any checked exception compulsory parent class method should throw same checked exception or its parent otherwise we will get compile time error but there are no restrictions for unchecked exceptions

```java


import java.io.*;

class P {
    public void m1() throws IOException{
        
    }
}

class C extends P {
    public void m1() throws EOFException, InterrruptedException{

    }
}

```



m1() in C cannot override m1() in P : overriddent method does not throw java.lang.InterruptedException



```

P : public void m1() throws Exeception.   // valid
C : public void m1()

P : public void m1()  // invalid
C : public void m1() throws Exception

P : public void m1() throws Exception // valid
C : public void m1() throws IOException

P : public void m1() throws IOException  // invalid
C : public void m1() throws Exception


P : public void m1() throws IOException // valid
C : public void m1() throws FileNotFoundException, EOFException

P : public void m1() throws IOException // invalid
C : public void m1() throws EOFException, InterruptedException // InterruptedException not child of IOException

P : public void m1() throws IOException // valid
C : public void m1() throws AE, NPE, CCE


```


9. Overridding wrt to static methods


1. We cannot override a static method as non-static otherwise we will get compile time error as class level method cannot be overridden by object level method




 ```java

 class P {
    public static void m1(){

    }
 }

 class C extends P {
    public void m1(){
        // CE : m1() in C cannot override m1() in P ; overridden method is static.
    }
 }
```
2. similarly we cannot override a non static method as static 

```java

 class P {
    public  void m1(){

    }
 }

 class C extends P {
    public static void m1(){
        // CE : m1() in C cannot override m1() in P ; overridding method is static.
    }
 }

```

3. If both parent and child class methods are static then we wont get any compile time error it seems overridding concept applicable for static methods but its not overridding and it is method hidding.

```java

 class P {
    public static void m1(){

    }
 }

 class C extends P {
    public static void m1(){
        
    }
 }

```

Method Hiding : All rules of method hiding are exactly same overridding except the following differences.

|Method Hiding | Overridding |
|-|-|
|Both parent and child class method should be static | both paretn and child class method should be non-static |
|Compiler is responsible for method resolution based on reference type | JVM is always responsible for method resolution based on runtime object |
|it is also known as compile time polymorphism, static polymorphism or early binding | Is it also known as runtime polymorphism, dynamic polymorphism and late binding



```java

class P{
    public static void m1(){
        System.out.println("parent");
    }
}

class C extends P {

    // It is method hiding but not overridding
    public static void m1(){
        System.out.println("child")
    }
}


class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        P p = new P();
        p.m1(); //parent

        C c = new C ();
        c.m1(); //child

        P p1 = new C ();
        p1.m1() //parent
    }
}

```

If both parent and child class methods are non static then it will become overridding 


```java

class P{
    public void m1(){
        System.out.println("parent");
    }
}

class C extends P {

    // It is method hiding but not overridding
    public void m1(){
        System.out.println("child")
    }
}


class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        P p = new P();
        p.m1(); //parent

        C c = new C ();
        c.m1(); //child

        P p1 = new C ();
        p1.m1() //child
    }
}

```

**Overridding with respect to var-arg methods**



We can override var-arg method with another var-arg method only if we are trying to override with normal method then it will become overloading but not overridding.

```java

class P {
    public void m1 (int... x){
        System.out.println("parent");
    }
}


class C extends P{
    public void m1(int x){
        System.out.println("child");
    }
}


class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        P p = new P ();
        p.m1(10); // Parent

        C c = new C ();
        c.m1(10); //Child

        P p1 = new C ();
        p1.m1(10); // Parent

        // As method signature is different the concept is overloading not overridding
    }
}

```

In the above program if we replace child method with var-arg method then it will become overridding. In this case the program will work as shown below

```java

class P {
    public void m1 (int... x){
        System.out.println("parent");
    }
}


class C extends P{
    public void m1(int... x){
        System.out.println("child");
    }
}


class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        P p = new P ();
        p.m1(10); // Parent

        C c = new C ();
        c.m1(10); //Child

        P p1 = new C ();
        p1.m1(10); // Child
    }
}

```



**Overridding with respect to variables**


Variable resolution always takes care by compiler based on reference type irrespective of whether the variable is static or non static 


==Overridding concept applicable only for methods but not for variables==



```java


class P {
    int x = 888;
}

class C extends P {
    int x = 999;
}


class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        P p = new P ();
        System.out.println(p.x); //888

        C c = new C ();
        System.out.println(c.x); //999

        P p1 = new C {};
        System.out.println(p1.x); //888
    }
}
```



|P:nonstatic<br>C:nonstatic| P:static<br>C:nonstatic|P:nonstatic<br>C:static | P:static<br>C:static|
|-|-|-|-|
888<br>999<br>888|888<br>999<br>888|888<br>999<br>888|888<br>999<br>888|




**Difference between Overloading and Overriding**


|property | overloading | overridding |
|-|-|-|
|method name | must be same | must be same |
|argument types| must be different (atleast order) | must be same |
|method signature| must be different | must be same |
|return types| no restrictions | must be same, until 1.4V from 1.5V onwareds covarient return types allowed
|private, static, final methods| can be overloaded | cannot be overridden|
|access modifiers| no restrictions | the scope of access modifiers can not be reduced but we can increase
|throws clause| no restrictions | if child class method throws any checked exception compulsory parent class method should throw same checked exception or its parent but no restriction for unchecked exceptions
|method resolution | always taken care by compiler based on reference type | always taken care by JVM based on runtime object
|also called | compile time polymorphism<br>static polymorhphism<br>early binding | runtime polymorphism<br>dynamic polymorphism<br>late binding


In overloading we have to check only method name (must be same) and argument types (must be different)

We are not required to check remaining like return types access modifiers ets

but in overriding everything we have to check like method names , argument types, access modifiers throws class etc.


Consider the following method in parent class :

public void m1(int x) throws IOException

In the child class which of the following methods we can take 

`public void m1 (int i) `  overriding

`public static int m1(long l) `  overloading

`public static void m1(int i)  `  fails as overridding

`public void m1(int i) throws Exception `  fails as overridding

`public static abstract void m1(double d) ` CE : illegal combination of modifier







**polymorphism**


Polymorphism - one name but multiple forms is the concept of polymorphism 

1. Method name is same but we can apply for different types of arguments (overloading) 

example

```
abs (int)

abs (long)

abs(float)

```

2. Method signature is same but in parent class one type of implementation and in child class another type of implementation (overridding)



example


```
class P {
    marry(){
        System.out.println("subba laxmi");
    }
}

class C {
    marry(){
        System.out.println("tanaya")
    }
}
```

Usage of parent reference to hold child object is the concept of polymorphism

```

Collections (I)
|- List (I)
    |- Linkedlist
    |- Arraylist
    |- Vector
        |- Stack


List l = new ArrayList ();
List l = new LinkedList ();
List l = new Stack ();
List l = new Vector ();
```



Parent class reference can be used to hold child object but by using that reference we can call only the methods available in parent class and we cant call child specific methods.


```
P has method  m1()
C has method m2()

```

```
P p = new C();

p.m1()
p.m2() // CE: cannot find symbol; Symbol : method m2(); Location : class P
```

But by using child reference we can call both parent and child class methods 


```
C c = new C();
c.m1();
c.m2();

```

When we should go for parent reference to hold child object, - If we dont know exact runtime type of object then we should go for parent reference

For example 
The first element present in arraylist can be any type it maybe student object or customer object , String object or StringBuffer object hence return type of get method is object which can hold any Object


Object o = l.get(0);




| C c = new C (); | P p = new C (); |
| -- |--|
|example ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); | List l = new ArrayList();
| We can use this approach if we know exact runtime type of object| We can use this approach if we dont know exact runtime type of object
| By using child reference we can call both parent class and child class method this is advantage of this approach | By using parent reference we can call only methods available in parent class and we cannot call child specific methods this is disadvantage of this approach
|We can use child reference to hold only particular child class object this is disadvantage of this approach | We can use parent reference to hold any child class object this is advantage of this approach |

**beautiful definition of polymorphism** : A BOY starts LOVE with the word FRIENDSHIP, but GIRL ends LOVE with same word FRIENDSHIP. Word is the same but attitude is different . This is nothing but ==polymorphism== (one name many forms)
