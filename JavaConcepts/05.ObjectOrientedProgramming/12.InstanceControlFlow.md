**Instance Control Flow**

Whenever we are executing a java class first static control flow will be executed in the static control flow if we are creating an object the following sequence of events will be executed as part of instance control flow.

Identification of Instance members from top to bottom 
Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom
Execution of constructor.



```java
class Test {
    int i = 10; //3 //9
    { // 4 
        m1(); //10
        System.out.println("First instance block"); //12
    }
    Test (){ // 5
        System.out.println("Constructor"); //15
    }
    public static void main (String[] args){ //1
        Test t = new Test (); //2
        System.out.println("main");
    }
    public void m1(){ //6
        System.out.println(j); //11
    }
    { //7 
        System.out.println("Second instance block"); //13
    }
    int j = 20; //8 //14
}

```

Static control flow is one time activity which will be performed at time of class loading but instance control flow is not one time activity and it will performed for every object creation.

Object creation is most costly operation if there is no specific requirement then it is not recommended to create object.

**Instance control flow in parent to child relationship**

Whenever we are creating child class objects the following sequence of events will be performed automatically as part of instance control flow.

Identification of instance members from parent to child
Execution of instance variable assignment and instance blocks only in parent class
Execution of parent constructor
Execution of instance variable assignment and instance blocks in child class
Execution of child constructor

```java
class Parent {
    int i = 10; //4 //15
    { //5
        m1(); //16
        System.out.println("Parent first instance block"); //18
    }
    Parent (){ //6
        System.out.println("Parent constructor"); //20
    }
    public static void main (String[] args){ //1
        Parent t = new Parent (); 
        System.out.println("main");
    }
    public void m1(){ //7
        System.out.println(j); //17
    }

    int j = 20; //8 //19
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int x = 100;   //9 //21
    {  //10
        m2(); //22
        System.out.println("Child first instance block");  //24
    }
    Child (){ //11
        System.out.println("Child constructor");  //27
    }
    public static void main (String[] args){ //2
        Child t = new Child (); //3
        System.out.println("Child main"); //28
    }
    public void m2(){ //12
        System.out.println(j); 
    }
    {  //13
        System.out.println("Child second instance block"); //23 //25
    }
    int y = 20;  //14 //26
}
```
