**Static Control Flow**


Whenever we are executing a java class the following sequence of steps will be executed as part of static control flow



1. Identification of static members from top to bottom
2. Execution of static variable assignments and static ==blocks== (not methods) from top to bottom
3. Execution of main method



```java


class Base {
    static int i = 10; // 1 , 7

    static { //2
        m1();  // 8
        System.out.println("First Static Block"); //10
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){ //3 
        m1(); //13
        System.out.println("Main Method");      //15   
    }

    public static void m1(){ //4 
        System.out.println( "J:" , j);//9 ,14
    }

    static { //5 
        System.out.println("Second Static Block"); //11
    }

    static int j = 20; //6 //12
}
```
Output : 
```

J: 0
First Static Block
Second Static Block
J: 20
Main Method

```


Inside a static block if we are trying to read a variable that read operation is called direct read.

If we are calling a method and within that method we are trying to read a variable then that read operation is called indirect read.

If a variable is just identified by JVM and original value not yet assigned then then variable is said to be in "read indirectly and write only state" - RIWO


If a variable is in RIWO state then we cant perform direct read but we can perform indirect read. If we are trying to read directly we will get CE : illegal forward reference



Examples


```java


class Test {

    static int x = 10;

    static {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

```


O/p 

```

10

RE : NoSuchMethodError : main

```


```java

class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println(x);
    }

    static int x = 10;
}

```

O/p

```
CE : illegal forward reference
```


```java

class Test {
    static {
        m1();
    }
    public static void m1(){
        System.out.println(x);
    }   
    static int x = 10;
}


```

**Static Block**

Static blocks will be executed at time of class loading hence at time of class loading if we want to perform any activity we have to define that inside static block.


At the time of java class loading the corresponding native libraries should be loaded hence we have to define this activity inside static block


```java
class Test {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("native library path")
    }
}
```


After loading every database driver class we have to register driver class with driver manager but inside database driver class there is a static block to perform this activity and we are not responsible to register explicitly




```java

class DbDriver{
    static {
        // Register this driver with driver manager
    }
}

```


Within a class we can declare any number of static block but all these static blocks will be executed from top to bottom.

Without writing main method is it possible to print some statement to console - Yes by using static block.


```java

class Test {
    
    static {
        System.out.println("Hello, I can print");
    }
}

```
```
Hello, I can print
RE : NoSuchMethodError : main
```


```java

class Test {
    
    static {
        System.out.println("Hello, I can print");
        System.exit(0)
    }
}

```
```
Hello, I can print
```

Without writing main method and static block, is it possible to print some statement to console

> Yes of course there are multiple ways 

```

class Test {
    static int x = m1();

    public static int m1(){
        System.out.println("Hello, I can print");
        System.exit(0);
        return 10;
    }
}
```


```

class Test {
    static Test t = new Test();
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, I can print");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}

```


```

class Test {
    static Test t = new Test ();

    Test (){
        System.out.println("Hello I can print");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```


From 1.7 version onwards main method is mandatory to start program execution hence 1.7 version onwards without writing main method it is impossible to print some statment to console.




**Static control flow in parent to child relationship**

Whenever we are executing child class the following sequence of event will be executed automatically as part of static control flow 


Identification of static members from parent to child

Execution of static variable assignment and static blocks from parent to child

Execution of only child class main method


```java

class Base {

    static int i = 10; //1 //12

    static { //2
        m1(); //13
        System.out.println("Base static class"); //15
    }

    public static void main (String[] args){ //3
        m1(); 
        System.out.println("Base main");
    }
    public static void m1(){ //4
        System.out.println(j); //14 
    }
    static int j = 20; //5 //16
}


class Derived extends Base {
    static int x = 100; //6 //17

    static { //7 
        m2() //18
        System.out.println("Derived first static class"); //19
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){ //8
        m2(); //22
        System.out.println("Derived main");
    }
    public static void m2(){ //9
        System.out.println(y); //23
    }
    static { //10
        System.out.println("Derived second static class") //20
    }

    static int y = 200; //11 //21

}




```


javac Base.java

java Derived
\
O/p
```

0
Base static class
0
Derived first static class
Derived second static class
200
Derived main
```

Whenecver we are loading child classs automatially parent class will be loaded but whenever we are laoding parent class, child class wont be loaded (because parent class members by default available to child class whereas child class members by default wont available to parent)
