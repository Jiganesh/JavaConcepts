**Abstraction**


HIding internal implementation and just highlight the set of services what we are offering is concept abstraction.


```
        BANK GUI SCREEN

        Withdraw
        Deposit
        Check Balance
        Mini Statement

```


Through Bank ATM GUI SCREEN Bank people are highlighting the set of service what they are offering witout highlighting internal implementtaion

The main advantages of abstraction are we can acheive securtiy because we are not highlighting our internal implementation without affecting outside person we are able to perform any type of changes in our system and enhancement will become easy.

It improves maintainablity of that application it improves easiness to use our system.


By using interface and abstract classes we can implement abstraction.
