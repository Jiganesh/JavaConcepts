We can use parent reference to hold child object 

Example 

> Object o = new String ("durga");

We can.  use interface reference to hold implemented class object 

Example  

> Runnable r = new Thread ();


A b = (C) d;

A = class | interface name 
b = name of reference variable
C = class | interface name 
D = reference variable name


Mantra 1 : Compile Time checking 1 : The type of "d" and "C" must have some relation either child to parent or parent to child or same type otherwise we will get compiletime error inconvertible types found "d" type required "C"

```
Object O = new String ("durga");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer) o;


String s = new String ("durga");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer) s;
```
```
CE : Inconvertible types
found : java.lang.String
required : java.lang.StringBuffer
```


Mantra 2 : Compile time checking 2 : "C" must be same or derived type of A otherwise we will get compile time error saying incompatiable types found "C" required "A"


Objec o = new String("durga")
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer) o;

```
Object o = new String ("durga");
StringBuffer sb = (String) o;
```
```
CE : Incompatible types
found : java.lang.String
required : java.lang.StringBuffer
```



Mantra 3 : Runtime checking  Runtime object type of "d" must be either same or derived type of "C" otherwise we will get runtime exception saying ClassCastException 
```
Object o = new String("durga");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;
```
RE : ClassCastException : java.lang.string cannot be cast to java.lang.StringBuffer

**Strictly speaking through type casting we are not creating any new object for the existing object we are providing another type of reference variable ie we are performing type casting but not object casting**



String s = new String ("durga");
Object o = (Object) s ;


can also be written in one line Object o = new String("durga")



```
    String s
            \

           {durga}

            /
    Object o 
```


Integer I = new Integer (10);

Number n = (Number) I;

Object o = (Object) n;


can be written as Object o = new Integer (10);



```
    Integer I
             \

 Number n --- {10}

            /
    Object o 
```



```

(B) c which is equivivalent to  B b = new C ();


(A)((B)c) which is equivivalent to (A) a = new C ();


```







P has m1()

C is child of P

C has m2()




C c = new C();

c.m1() valid
c.m2() valid
((P)c).m1() valid
((P)c).m2() invalid which is P p = new C (); and p.m2();



Parent reference can be used to hold child object but by using that reference we cant call child specific methods and we can call only methods available in parent class.






```
A class contains m1() which prints A

B is child of A

B class contains m1() which prints B

C is child of B

C class contains m1() which prints C
```
```



C c = new C();

c.m1(); // prints C

((B) c).m1() // prints C

((A)((B)c)).m1() // prints C

```

It is overridding and method resolution is based on runtime object.



```


A class contains static m1() which prints A

B is child of A

B class contains static m1() which prints B

C is child of B

C class contains static m1() which prints C

```
```


C c = new C();

c.m1(); // prints C

((B) c).m1() // prints B

((A)((B)c)).m1() // prints A

```

It is method hiding and method resolution is based on reference type 



```


A class contains int x = 777;

B is child of A

B class contains int x = 888;

C is child of B

C class contains int x = 999;

```
```



C c = new C();

c.x; // prints 999

((B) c).x // prints 888

((A)((B)c)).x // prints 777


```

Variable resolution is always based on reference type but not based on runtime object
