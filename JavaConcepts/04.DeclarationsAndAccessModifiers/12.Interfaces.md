Introduction : 

Definition 1 : Any service requirement specification (SRS) is considered as interface. 

Example 1 : JDBC API acts as requirement specification to develop database driver. Database vendor is responsible to implement this JDBC API


JDBC API
|- Oracle Driver
|- MYSQL Driver
|- DBL Driver


Servlet API
|- Apache Tomcat Server
|- Oracle Weblogic Server
|- IBM Websphere Server


Servlet API acts as requirement specification to develop webserver. Webserver vendor is responsible to implement Servlet API.


Definition 2 : 

From client point of view an interface defines the set of services what he is expecting from service provider point of view an interface defines the set of services what he is offering hence any contract between client and service provider is considered as interface.

Example : Throught BANK ATM GUI screen the bank people are highlighting the set of services they are offering. the same GUI screen is showing the set of services which customer is expecting hence GUI screen acts as contract beteween customer and bank


```

customer   ----> BANK ATM GUI SCREEN <----------- Bank


                Mini Statement
                Banking
                Deposit

```


Inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declaring or not - hence interface is considered as 100% pure abstract class 


Summary Definition:

Any service requirement specification or any contract between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract class is nothing but interface.





**Interface declaration and Implementation**



```java

interface Interface {
    void m1();
    void m2();
}
```


```java

// (abstract - if not all definition) CE : ServiceProvider is not abstract and does not override abstract method m2

abstract class ServiceProvider implements Interface {

    // (always keep public ) CE : m1 in ServiceProvider cannot implement m1 in Interface; attempting to assign weaker access privilates ; Was public
    public void m1(){

     };
}
```


```java
class SubServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {

    public void m2(){

    };
};
```

Whenever we are implementing a interface for each and every method of that interface we have to provide implementation otherwise we have to declare class as abstract then next level child class is responsible to provide implementation.

Every interface method is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not hence whenever we are implementing an interface method compulsory we should declare as public otherwise we will get compile time error.



extends VS implements


A class can extend only one class at a time
A Interface can extend any number of interface simultaneously
> interface C extends A, B

A class can implement any number of interface simultaneously
> class A implements B, C

A class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously
> class A extends B implements C, D, E




Which of the following is valid


A class can extend any number of classes at a time (invalid)
A class can implement only one interface at at time (invalid)
A Interface can extend only one interface at at ime (invalid)
An Interface can implement any number of interface simulatenouly (invalid)
A class can extend another classs and can implement an interface but not both simultaneously (invalid)
None of the above



Consider the following expression - for whcih of the follwing possiblities of X and Y the above expression is valid
> X extends Y


Both X and Y should be classes
Both X and Y should be interfaces
Both X and Y can be either classes or interfaces (correct)
No restrictions



> X extends Y, Z

X, Y, Z should be interfaces


> X implement Y, Z

X should be class and Y, Z should be interface


> X extends Y implements Z

X , Y should be classes and Z should be interface


> X implements Y extends Z 
Invalid CE : because we have to take extends first followed by interface



**Interface Methods**

Every method present inside interface is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not.


```java

interface Interf{
    void m1();
}

```
Why it is public and abstract by default ?

public - to make this method available to every implementation class
abstract - implementation class is responsible to provide implementation


hence inside interface all this method declarations are equal 


void m1 ();
public void m1();
abstract void m1();
public abstract void m1();

as every interface method is  always abstract and public we cannot declare interface method with following modifiers : private, protected, static, final , synchronized, strictfp, native

Which of the following method declaration are allowed inside interface ?

public void m1(){}
private void m1();
protected void m1();
static void m1();
public abstract native void m1();
abstract public void m1();  (only valid)



**Interface Variables**

An interface can contain variable. Main purpose of interface variable is to define requirement level constants.

```java

interface Iterf {
    int x = 10;
}


```
Every interface variable is public static final whether we declare it or not ?

public - to make this variable available to eery implementation class

static - without existing object also implementation class can access this variable

final - If one implementation class changes value then remaining implementation class will be affected.
    to restrict this every interface variable is always final



Inside interface all this variable declarations are equal 


int x = 10;
public int x = 10;
static int x = 1;
final int x = 10;
public static int x = 10;
public final int x = 1;
static final int x = 10;
public static final int x = 10;

As every interface variable is public static final we cant declare with following modifiers private, protected, transient, volatile

For Interface Varioable compulsory we should perform initialization at time of declaration otherwise we will get compile time error as shown below 
```java

interface Interf{
    int x ;
}

```

CE : = expected

```java

interface Interf{
    int x ;
}

```
CE : illegal start of expression


Inside interface which of the following variable declaration are allowed ?

int x ;
private int x = 10;
protected int x = 19;
volatile int x = 10;
transient int x = 10;
public static int x =10; (only valid declaration)


Inside implementation class we can access interface variables but we cannot modify values.

```java

interface Interf {
    int x = 10;
}

```

```java

class Test implements Interf {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        x = 777; // Cannot assign value to final variable x;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```


```java

class Test implements Interf {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int x = 777; // local variable so the code works
        System.out.println(x); // 777
    }
}
```

**interface naming conflicts**


Case 1 : If two interface contains method with same signature and same return type then in implementation class we have to provide implementation for only one method (m1 in below example).


```java

interface Left {
    public void m1();
}

```

```java

interface Right{
    public void m1();
}

```


```java

class Test implements Left, Right {
    public void m1(){

    }
}
```

Case 2 : If two interfaces contains a method with same name but different argument types then in implementation class we have provide implementation for both methods and these methods acts as overloaded methods.


```java

interface Left {
    public void m1();
}

```

```java

interface Right{
    public void m1(int x);
}

```


```java

class Test implements Left, Right {
    public void m1(){ // Overloaded methods

    }

    public void m1(int x){ // Overloaded methods

    }
}
```

Case 3 : If twot interface contains a method with same signature but different return types then it is impossible to implement both interfaces simulateouly if return types are not covarient.

```java

interface Left {
    public void m1();
}

```

```java

interface Right{
    public int m1(int x);
}

```
We cant write any java class which implements both interface simultaneously. Is a java class can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously yes except a particular case if two interface contains a method with same signature but different return types then it is impossible to implement both interface simultaneously




**Interface Variable naming conflicts**


Two interfaces can contain a variable with same name and there maybe a chance of variable naming conflicts but we can solve this problem by using interface names.
```java
interface Left {
    int x = 777;
}


interface Right {
    int x = 888;
}


class Test implements Left, Right {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println(x) // CE : reference to x is ambigous
        System.out.println(Left.x) // 777;
        System.out.println(Right.x) // 888;
    }
}
```

**Marker Interface**


If an interface doesnt contain any methods and by implementing that interface if our object will get some ability such type of interface are called marker interfaces

These are marked for some ability

- Serializable (I)
- Clonable (I)
- RandomAccess (I)
- SingleThreadModel(I)

Marker Interface = Ability Interface = Tag Interfaces

Example : By implementing Serializable Interface our object can be saved in file and can travel across the network
Example : BY implmenting clonable interface our objects are in position to produce exact duplicate cloned objects

Without having any methods how the objects will get some ablity in market interfaces ?

Internally JVM is responsible to provide required ability  (why JVM is required ability in Marker Interface) = To reduce complexity in programming and to make java language as simple. 


Is it possible to define our own marker Interface ?
> Yes, but customization of JVM is required.


**Adapter Classes**

Adapter class is simple java class that implements an interface with only empty implementation 

```java


interface X {
    void m1();
    void m2();
    ...
    void m100();
}

abstract class AdapterX implements X {
    m1(){}
    m2(){}
    m2(){}
    ...
    m100(){}
}
```
If we implment an interface for each and every method of that interface compulsory we should provide implementation wheter it is required or not required


```
class Test implements x {
    m1(){

    }
    ...

    m2(){

    }
}


```

Problem with this approach is it increases lenght of code and reduces readablity we can solve these problem using adapter classes. Instead of implmenting interface classes if we extend adapter class we have to provide implementation only for required methods and we are not responsible to provide implementation for each and every method of that interface so that length of the code will be reduced.



```java

class Test extends AdapterX{
    m1();
}

class Sample extends AdapterX{
    m2();
}

class Demo extends AdapterX{
    m3();
}
```


In How many ways we can develop Servlet ?
We can develop a servlet in followign three ways

- By implementing Servlet (I) interface
- By extending GenericServlet (AC)
- By extending HTTPServlet (AC)

If we implement servlet interface for each and every method of that interface we should provide implementation, it increases length of the code and reduces readablity, instead of implementing servlet interface directly if we extend generic servlet we have to provide implementation only for service method. And for all remaining methods we are not required to provide implementation

Hence more or less GenericServlet acts as AdapterClass for Servlet INterface.

Note : Marker Interface and Adapter Classes simplifies complexity of programming and these are best utilities to the programmer and programmers life will become simple.

**Interface vs Abstract Class vs Concrete Class**

If we dont know anything about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.

Interface - Servlet (I)


If we are talking about implementation but not completely (partial implementation) then we should go for abstract class.

Abstract Class - GenericServlet (AC), HTTPServlet (AC)

If we are talking about implementation completely and ready to provide service then we should go for concrete class

Concrete Class - MyOwnServlet (CC)


Example:

Interface - Servlet (I)
Abstract Class - GenericServlet (AC), HTTPServlet (AC)
Concrete Class - MyOwnServlet (CC)


Real World Example
Interface - Plan of Building
Abstract Class - Partially Completed Building
Concrete Class - Completed Building


Difference between Interface and Abstract Class


| Interface   | Abstract Class |
| - | - |
|If we dont know anything about implementation and just we have requirement specification then we go for interface   |If we are talking about implementation but not completely (partial implementaiton) then we should go for abstract class   |
|  Inside interface every method is public and abstract whether we declare or not hence interface is consider 100%pure abstract classs | Every method inside abstract class need not be public and abstract and we can take concrete methods also   |
| As Every interface method is always public and abstract and hence we cant declare with following modifiers private, protected, final, static, synchronized, native, strictfp  | There are not restriction on abstract class methods modifiers   |
| Every variable present inside interface is always public static final Wheterh we are declaring or not | every variable present inside abstract class need not be public stativ final   |
| As every interface variable is always public static final we cannot declare with the following modifiers private, protected, volatile and transient| there are no restriction on abstract class variable modifiers |
| for interface variables compulsory we shoudl perfomr initialization at time of declaration only  otherwise we will get compile time error |for abstract class variable we are not required to perform initiazliation at timme of declaraiton|
| INside interface we cant declare static and instnace blocks | Inside abstract class we can delcare static and instance block | 
|Inside interface we cannt dclare constructor| Inside abstract class we can declare constructors|


Anyways we cannt create object for abstract class but abstract class can contain constructor what is the need ?

> Abstract Class Constructor will be executed whenever we are creating child classs object to perform initialization of child class object.


Approach 1 : Without having constructor in abstract class - More code, More redundancy (not recommended)


```java

abstract class Person {
    String name ;
    int age;
    // ... 100 properties
}


class Student extends Person {
    int rollno;

    Student (String name, int age , ...){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        ...
        this.rollno = rollno;
    }
}

Student s = new Student (101 properties)


class Teacher extends Person {
    int subject;

    Student (String name, int age , ...){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        ...
        this.subject = subject;
    }
}

Teacher t = new Teacher (101 properties)
```



Approach 2 : With Having constructor in Abstract Class - Less Code and Code reusablity


```java

abstract class Person {
    String name ;
    int age;
    // ... 100 properties

    Person (String name, int age,  ...) { // This constructor will work for every child object initialization
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        //... 100 lines of code
    }
}


class Student extends Person {
    int rollno;

    Student (String name, int age , ...){
        super(...); // ... are 100 attribute values
        this.rollno = rollno;
    }
}

Student s = new Student (...) // ... are 101 attribute values


class Teacher extends Person {
    int subject;

    Student (String name, int age , ...){
        super(...); // ... are  100 properties
        this.subject = subject;
    }
}

Teacher t = new Teacher (...) // ... are 101 properties
```

Anyways we cant create objects for abstract class and interface but abstract class can contain constructor but interface doesnt contain constructor what is the reason ?

The main purpose of constructor is to perfom initialization for the instance variable abstract class can contain instance variable which are required for child object to perform initialization of those instance variable constructor is required for abstract class but every variable present inside interface is always public static final whether we are declaring or not and there is no exisiting instance variable inside interface hence constructor concept is not required for interface.

Whenever we are creating child class object parent object wont be created just parent class constructor will be executed for the child object purpose only


```java

class P {
    P (){
        System.out.println(this.hashCode()); //11394033
    }
}

class C extends P {
    C (){
        System.out.println(this.hashCode()); //11394033
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){

        C c  = new C ();

        System.out.println(c.hashCode()); //11394033
    }
}

```

Inside interface every method is always abstract and we can take only abstract methods in abstract class also then what is the difference between interface and abstract class ? Is it possible to replace interface concept with abstract class ?

We can replace interface with abstract class but it is not a good programming practice this is something like recruting IAS officer for sweeping activity. If everything is abstract then it is highly recommended to go for interface but not for abstract class


Approach 1 👍


```java

abstract class X {

}

class Test extends X{

}


```

While extending abstract class it is not possible to extend any other class and hence we are missing inheritance benefit

In this case object creation is costly
> Test t = new Test1()


Approach 2 👍


```java

interface X {

}

class Test implements X{

}

```

While implementing interface we can extend some other class and we wont miss any inheritanc benefit

In this case object creation is not costly (no constructor execution or initialization)

> Test t = new Test(); 2 sec
