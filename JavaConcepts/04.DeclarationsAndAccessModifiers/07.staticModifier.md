Static is modifier applicable for methods and variables but not for classes. we cannot declare top level class with static modifier but we can declare inner class as static. such type of inner classes are called statice nested classes.


In the case of instance variables for every object a separate copy will be created but in the case of static variable a single copy will be created at class level and shared by every object of that class.



```

class Test {
    static int = 10;
    int y = 20;

    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Test t1 = new Test ();
        t1.x = 888;
        t1.y = 999;

        Test t2 = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t2.x + "....." + t2.y) ; // 888.....20
    }
}

```



We cannot access intance members directly from static area but we can access from instance area directly
We can access static member from both instance and static area directly


```
class Test {
    int x = 10;
    static int y = 20;

    public void m1(){
        System.out.println(x);
    }

    public static void m1(){
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

```



Consider the following declarations:

> int x = 10;

> static int x = 10;

> public void m1(System.out.println(x));

> public static void m1(){ System.out.println(x)};


Within the same class which of the above declaration we can take simultaneously



-  i and iii
- i and iv // CE : non-static variable x cannot be referenced from a static context
- ii and iii
- ii and iv
- i and ii // CE : variable x is already defined in x
- iii and iv // CE : m1 is already defined in Test




Case 1 : 

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("String[] args");
    }

    public static void main (int[] args){
        System.out.println("int[] args")
    }
}

Overloading concept applicable for main method but JVM can always call String[] args main method only


Other overloaded method we have to call just like normal method call


Case 2 : Inheritance concept applicable for static method including main method hence while executing child class if child doesnt contain main method then parent class main method will be executed
```

class P {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("parent main");
    }
}


class C extends P {

}
```


javac P.java

P.class
C.class

java P O/p Parent main
java C O/p Parent main



Case 3: Method Hiding but not overridding, It seems overridding concept applicatble for static method and it is not overidding but method hidding

```

class P {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("parent main");
    }
}


class C extends P {
        public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("child main");
    }
}
```

javac P.java

 |-P.class
 |-C.class

java P O/p Parent main
java C O/p Child main

For static method overloading and inheritance concepts are applicable but overridding concepts are not applicable but instead of overridding method hiding concept is applicable


Insides method implementation if we are using atleast one instance variable then that method talks about a particular object hence we should declare method as instance method


Inside method implementation if we are not using any instance variable then this method nowhere releated to a particular object hence we have to declare such type of method as atic method irrespective to we are using static variable or not





```java

class Student{
    String name;
    int rollno;
    int marks;
    static String cname;
    
    getStudentInfo(){
        return name + "......" + marks;
    } // instance method


    getCollegeInfo(){
        return cname;
    } // static method

    getAverage (int x , int y){
        return x + y / 2;
    } // static method

    getCompletInfo(){
        return name + "  " + rollno  + "  " + marks  + "  " + cname;
    } // instance method
}

```
For static methods implemenation should be available whereas for abstract methods implementation shoudl not be available therefor abstract static combination is illegal for methods
