transient is a modifier applicable only for variables


we can use transient keyword in serialization context.


At the time of serialization if we dont want to save value of particular variable to meet security constraint then we should declare that variable as transient. At the time of serialization JVM ignores original value of transient variable and save default value to the file.




transient means not to serialize.

Username : jiganesh
transient password : tanaya      
                                Serialization

                                                File.txt
                                                Username : jiganesh
                                                password : null

                                Deserialization
                                <---------------
