**volatile modifier**


volatile is a modifier only for variables and we cant apply anywhere else.


If the value of a variable keep on changing by multiple thread then there maybe a chance of data inconsistency problem we can solve this problem by using volatile keyword

if your variable is declared volatile then for every thread jvm will create separate local copy every modification performed by thread will take place in local copy so there is not affect on remaining threads


The main advantage of volatile keywords is we can overcome data inconsistency problem but the main disadvantage of volatile keyword is creating and maintaing a separate copy for every thread increases complexity of programming and creates performance problem hence if there is no speicific requirement then it is not recommended to use volatile keyword and it is almost deprecated keyword


final variable means the value never changes - whereas volatile variable is value keep on changing hence volatile final is illegal combination for variables

The only applicable modifier for local variable is final

The only applicable modifier for constructor are public private protected default

The modifiers which are applicable only for methods native

The modifiers which are applicable for classes but not for interfaces final

The modifiers which are applicable for classes but not for enum final and abstract
