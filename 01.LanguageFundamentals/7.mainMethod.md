Whether class contains main method or not and whether main method is declared according to requirement or not these things wont be checked by compiler. At runtime JVM is responsible to check these things. If JVM unable to find main method then we will get runtime exception saying No such method error main.


```java

class Test {

}
```

Runtime Exception:

```
ERROR!
Error: Main method not found in class Test, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```


At runtime JVM always searches for main method with following prototype.


public : To call by JVM from anywhere


static : Without existing object also JVM has to call this method


void : main () method wont return anything to JVM


main : This is the name which is configured inside JVM 

String[] args : command line arguments





The above syntax is very strict and if we perform any change then we will get runtime exception saying "no such method error: main"


Even though above syntax is very strict the following changes are acceptable 

1. Instead of public static we can take static public ie the order of modifiers is not important 

2. we can declare string array in any acceptable form


```
String []args

String args[]

String[] args
```
3. Instead of args we can take any valid java identifier

> main(String[] jiganesh)



4. We can replace String[] with var-arg parameter

> main(String... args)


5. We can declare main method with following modifiers final, synchronized, strictfp


Valid main method :

> static final synchronized strictfp public void main (String... args) 


Which are the following main method declarations are valid ?


```java

public static void main (String args) : invalid
public static void Main (String[] args) : invalid
public void main (String[] args) : invalid
public static int main (String[] args) : invalid
final synchronized strictfp public void main (String[] args) : invalid
final synchronized strictfp public static void main (String[] args) : valid
public static void main (String... args) : valid
```

In which of the above cases we will get compile time error ?

There is no case where we will get compile time error, but except last two cases in remaining we will get runtime exception no such method error : main





Case 1: Overloading of the main method is possible but JVM will always call String[] args main method only. The other overloaded method we have to call explicitly like normal method call.

```java

class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("String[]"); // O/P : String[]
    }
    public static void main(int[] args){
        System.out.println("int[]");
    }
}

```

Case 2: Inheritance concept applicable for main method, hence while executing child class if a child doesnt contain main method then parent class main method will be executed.


```java

class P {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Parent Main");
    }
}

class C extends P{

}

```


```
Java P enter 
O/p : Parent main


Java C enter
O/p : Parent main

```

Case 3: It seems overriding concept applicable for main method but it is not overriding and it is method hiding.For main method inheritance and overloading concepts are applicable but overriding concept is not applicable. Instead of overriding , method hiding is applicable.

```java

class P {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Parent main");
    }
}

class C extends P{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Child main")
    }

}

```

```
Java P enter 
O/p : Parent main


Java C enter
O/p : Child main

```

1.7 Version Enhacements


Enhancement 1 : 
Until 1.6 version if the class doesnt contain main method then we will get runtime exception : <br> NoSuchMethodError: main

From 1.7 onward we will get more elaborated error information <br>Error : Main method not found in class Test, please declared main method as public static void main (String[] args)



Enhancement 2 : 
From 1.7 version onwards main method is mandatory hence even thought class contains static block it wont be executed if the class doesnt contain main method

```java

class Test{
    static {
        System.out.println("static Block")
    }
}
```

In 1.6 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
static block
Runtime Exception : NoSuchMethodError: main
```

In 1.7 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
ERROR!
Error: Main method not found in class Test, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```


Enhancement 3: 

```java

class Test{
    static {
        System.out.println("static Block")
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

In 1.6 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
static block
```

In 1.7 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
ERROR!
Error: Main method not found in class Test, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```


Enhacement 4:

```java

class Test{
    static {
        System.out.println("static block")
        System.exit(0);
    }

    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("main method")
    }
}
```

In 1.6 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
static block
main method

```

In 1.7 Version

javac Test.java
java Test
```
static block
main method
```


Enhancement 5


Flow in 1.6 version


Identification of static method

Execute static block and static variable assignments

Check for Main method 
    - If available execute main()
    - If not available RE : NoSuchMethodError : main



Flow in 1.7 Version

Check for Main method 
    - If not available RE : NoSuchMethodError : main

Identification of static method

Execute static block and static variable assignments

Execute Main



Without writing main method is it possible to print some statements to console ?

Yes by using static block but this rule is applicable until 1.6 version, but from 1.7 version it is impossible to print some statement to console without writing main method.
