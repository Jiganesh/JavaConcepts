DataTypes

In Java every variable and every expression has some type. Each and every datatype is clearly defined. Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatiblity because of above reason we can conclude Java language is strongly typed programming language. 

Java is pure object oriented programming language ?
Java is not considered as pure object oriented programming language because several features are not satisfied by Java like operator overloading and multiple inheritance etc.

Moreover we are depending on primitive datatypes which are not objects like int etc.


**Primitive Datatypes** (8)

- Primitive Datatypes
    1. Numeric datatypes (Signed Datatypes +-)
        1. Integer datatype
            1. byte
            2. short
            3. int
            4. long
        2. Floating point datatypes
            1. float
            2. double
    2. Non Numberic datatypes
        - char
        - boolean

Expect char and boolean all datatypes are considered signed datatypes as they can be represented as positive and negative


**Integer Datatypes**

| Type | Size | Range | Application|
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| byte | 8 bits | -128 to 127 | Byte is best choice if you want to handle data in terms of strings either from the file or from the network. File supported form or Network supported form is byte.
|short|2 bytes ie 16 bits| -2 ^15^ to 2 ^15^ -1|short is most rarely used datatype in Java. short datatype is best suitable for 16 bits processors like 8085 and 8086 but these processors are completely outdated and hence corresponding short datatype is outdated datatype|
|int|4 bytes ie 32 bits|-2^31^ to 2^31^ -1|Most commonly used datatype is int|
|long| 8 bytes | -2 ^63^ to 2 ^63^ -1| file.length() |



All the above datatype byte, short, int, long meant for representing integral values. If we want to represent floating point values then we should go for floating point datatypes.

The Most Significant Bit acts as signed bit - 0 means positive number 1 means negative number. Positive numbers will be represented directly in a memory. whereas negative numbers will be represented in 2's compliement form.

byte b = 128 ; which error ? 
```
CE : possible loss of precision 
    found : int 
    required : byte
```

byte b = 10.5 ; which error ? 

```
CE : possible loss of precision 
    found : double 
    required : byte
```

byte b = true ; which error ? 

```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : boolean 
    required : byte
```


byte b = "durga" ; which error ? 

```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : java.util.String 
    required : byte
```


int x = 2147483648 ; which error ?
```
CE : integer number too large

```

int x = 2147483648l ; which error ?
int x = 2147483648L ; which error ?
```
CE : possible loss of precision
    found : long
    required : int
```

int x = true ; which error ?
```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : boolean
    required : byte

```

Sometime int may not enough to hold big values then we should go for long type Example : The amound of distance travelled by light in 1000 days to hold this value int may not enough we should go for long datatype l = 126000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000 

Example : The number of characters present in big file may exceed int range hence the return type of length method is long but not int

long l = file.length ( )

**Floating Point Datatypes**

| Type | Size | Range | Application|
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| float | 4 bytes ie 32 bits | -3.4E+38 to +3.4E+38| float follows single precision (7 decimal places of accuraccy)|
| double | 8 bytes ie 64 bits| -1.7E+308 to +1.7E+308|double follows double precision (16 decimal places of accuracy)|


3.4E+38 = 3.4 * 10 ^38^

**Boolean Datatype**

In Java size of boolean not applicable [VM Dependent]. Range is also not applicable but allowed values are true or false.


boolean b = true; (valid)

boolean b = 0; which error ?

```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : int
    required : boolean
```

boolean b = True; which error ?

```
CE : cannot find symbol 
    symbol : variable True
    location : class Test
```

boolean b = "True"; which error ?

```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : java.lang.String
    required : boolean
```




Question:

```java

class Test {

    public static void main (String[] args){
        int x = 0

        if (x){
            System.out.println("Hello")
        }else{
            System.out.println("Hi")
        }
    }
}

```

Error at if condition ?:

```
CE : incompatible types
    found : int
    required : boolean
```


**char Datatype**

Old languages like C or C++ are ASCII code based and the number of different ascii code characters are <= 256 to represent these 256 characters 8 bits are enough and hence the size of char in old languages is 1 byte. but Java is unicode based and number of different unicode characters are > 256 and <= 65536 to represent these many characters 8 bits may not enough compulsory we should go for 16 bits. Hence size of char in Java is 2 bytes.


| Type | Size | Range | Application|
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| char | 2 bytes | 0 to 65535 | String|


Summary of Java primitive Datatypes



| Type | Size | Range | Wrapper | Default Value |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| byte | 1 byte | -128 to 127 |  Byte | 0
|short|2 bytes| -2 ^15^ to 2 ^15^ -1|Short| 0 
|int|4 bytes|-2^31^ to 2^31^ -1|Integer | 0
|long| 8 bytes | -2 ^63^ to 2 ^63^ -1| Long | 0
|float|4 bytes | -3.4E+38 to +3.4E+38 | Float | 0.0
|double|8 bytes | -1.7E+308 to +1.7E+308| Double | 0.0
|boolean| NA | NA (but allowed values are true/false) | Boolean | false |
|char| 2 bytes | 0 to 65535 | Character | 0 [represents space character] |


null is the default value for Object reference and cannot be applied to primitives - if trying to use null for the primitive types it will result in compile time error

char ch = null; which error ?

```
CE : imcompatible types
    found : <nulltype>
    required : char

```
