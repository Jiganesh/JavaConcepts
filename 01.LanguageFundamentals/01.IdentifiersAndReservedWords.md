**Identifiers** - A name in java program is called identifier which can be used for identification purpose. It can be method name, class name, variable name or label name.

Example-

```java

class Test{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int x = 10;
    }
}

```

How many identifiers are there in above code ?
- **5** - Test (class name), main (method name), String (predefined class name), args (name of array), x (name of variable)


**Rules for defining Java Identifiers**
- Can only consist A-Z, a-z, $, _ (If we are using any other character we will get compile time error)
- Identifier should not start with digit 
- Java Identifiers are case sensitive - Java language itself is treated as case sensitive programming language
- Reserved words cannot be used as an identifiers 



```java
class Test {

    int number = 10;
    int Number = 10;
    int NUMBER = 10;
}
```

In Java Indentifier how many characters are allowed ? 
- There is no length limit for java identifiers (but it is not good programming practice)

Example :
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int String = 888;
        System.out.println(String);

        int Runnable = 999;
        System.out.println(Runnable);

    }
}
```
Output :
```
888
999
```

The code is perfectly valid as String and Runnable are predefined class name and not reserved words. Class names and interface names we can use as identifiers but it is bad programming practice because it reduces readablity and creates confusion.


Which of the following are valid java identifiers ?

- `total_number` : valid
- `total#` :  invalid (# symbol not allowed)
- `123total` : invalid (should not start with number)
- `total123` : valid
- `$_$_$_$`: valid
- `java2share` : valid
- `all@hands` : invalid (@ symbol not allowed)
- `Integer` : valid
- `Int`: valid
- `int`: invalid (reserved word)



**Reserved Words**

In java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such type of words are called reserved words.


Reserved Words = 53
- Keywords (50)    
    - Used Keywords (48)
    - Unused Keywords (2) 
- Reserved Literals(3)
    - true
    - false
    - null


Keywords for datatypes (8)

- byte
- short
- int 
- long
- float
- double 
- boolean 
- char

Keywords for flow control (11)

- if
- else
- switch
- case
- default
- do 
- while
- for 
- break
- continue
- return

Keywords for modifiers (11)

- private
- public
- protected
- static
- final
- abstract
- synchronized
- native
- strictfp (1.2 Version)
- transient
- volatile



Keywords for exception handling (6)

- try
- catch
- finally
- throw
- throws
- assert (1.4 Version)


Class related Keywords (6)

- class
- interface
- extends
- implements
- package
- import


Object related keywords (4)

- new
- instanceof
- super
- this


void return type keyword (1)

**In Java return type is mandatory, If a method wont return anything we have to declare that method with void return type but In C language return type is optional and default return type is int**

Unused Keywords (2) - If we use we will get compile time error

- goto (usage of goto created several problems in oled languages and hence it was banned)
- const (use final instead of const)


Reserved Literals (3)

- true (value for boolean datatype)
- false (value for boolean datatype)
- null (default value for object reference)


Enum Keyword (1) (1.5 Version)

We can use enum to define a group of named constants.

```java

enum Week{
    SUN,
    MON,
    TUE,
    WED,
    THU,
    FRI,
    SAT
}

```

**All 53 reserved words in java contains only lowercase alphabet symbols**

**In Java we have only new keyword, and there is no delete keyword, because destruction of useless objects is responsiblity of garbage collector**


These following are new keywords in Java
```
strictfp (1.2 version)
assert (1.4 version)
enum (1.5 version)
```


`strictfp` but not `strictFP`
`instanceof` but not `instanceOf`
`synchronized` but not `synchronize`
`extends` but not `extend`
`implements` but not `implement`
`import` but not `imports`
`const` but not `constant`


Which of the following list contains only Java reserved words ? (Mark Java Reserved Words)

- `new`, delete
- `goto`, constant
- `break`, `continue`, `return`, exit
- `final`, `finally`, finalize
- `throw`, `throws`, thrown,
- notify, notifyALl
- `implements`, `extends`, imports
- sizeof, `instanceof`
- instanceOf, strictFp
- `byte`, `short`, Int
- None of the above - Correct Answer 



Which of the following are Java Reserved words

- public (Reserved Word)
- static (Reserved Word)
- void (Reserved Word)
- main
- String (Predefined Class)
- args
