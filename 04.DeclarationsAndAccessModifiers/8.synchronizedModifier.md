**synchronized modifier**



synchronized is a modifier applicable for methods and blocks but not for classes and variables

If multiple threads are trying to operate simultaneouly on the smae java object then there maybe a chance of data inconsistency probjem this is called race condition we can overcome this problem by using synchronized keyword. If a method or block declared as synchornized then at a time only one thread is allowed to operate/ execute that method or block on given object so that data inconsistency problem will be resolved


but the main disadvantage of synchronized keyword is it increases waiting time of thread and creates performance problem. if there is no specific requirement then its not recommended to use synchronized keyword.


If a method declared as synchronized - synchronized method should compulsory contain implemenation whereas abstract method doesnt contain any implementation hence abstract synchronized is illegal combination of modifiers for methods.
