A Java program can contain any number of classes but atmost one class can be declared as public 

If there is public class then name of program and name of public class must be matched otherwise we will get compile time error.


Case 1 : If there is no public class then we can use any name and there are no restrictions

Valid code and compiles
```java
class A{

}
class B{

}
class C{

}
```

Case 2 : If class B is public then name of the program should be B.java

```java
class A{

}
public class B{

}
class C{

}
```

```
CE : class B is public, should be declared in a file name B.java
```

Case 3 : If class B and C is public then name of the program should be B.java

```java
class A{

}
public class B{

}
public class C{

}
```

```
CE : class C is public, should be declared in a file name C.java
```




Durga.java
```java

class A {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}
class B {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}class C {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("C");
    }
}class D {
    
}
```



Whenever we are compiling a java program for every class present in the program a separate .class file will be generated. We can compile a java program (java src file) but we can run a java.class

Whenever we are executing a java class the corresponding class main method will be executed. 


```

javac durga.java


java A enter
A
java B enter
B
java C enter
C
java D enter
RE : NoSuchMethodError : main
java durga enter
RE : NoClassDefFoundError : durga
```

compiling durga.java generates A.class B.class C.class D.class


If the class doesn't contain main method then we will get runtime exception saying NoSuchMethodError : main


If corresponding .class file not available we will get runtime exception saying NoClassDefFoundError : durga


It is not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single source file, It is highly recommended to declare only one class per source file and name of program. We have to keep same as class name.

The main advantage of this approach is readablity and maintainablity of the code will be improved.
