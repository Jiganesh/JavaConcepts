packages

It is an encapsulation mechanism to group related class and interfaces into a single unit which is nothing but package 


Example1: All classes and interfaces are required for database operation are grouped into a single package which is nothing but java.sql package


Example2 : All classes and interfaces which are useful for file io operation are grouped into separate package which is nothing but java.io package.


The main advantages of package are 

- to resolve naming conflicts ie unique identification of our components
- it improves modularity of application
- it improves maintainablity of application
- it provide security for our components


> com.icicibank.loan.housing.Account

The naming convention for packages to use internet domain name in reverse.

com.icicibank = clients internet domain name in reverse
loan = module
housing = submodule name
Account = class name

This is universally accepted naming convention for packages

```java

package com.durgasoft.scjp;

public class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("package demo");
    }
}
```


javac Test.java

After compilation generated .class file will be placed in current working directory

```
cwd
 |- Test.class

```


javac -d . Test.java 

-d = destination to place generated .class files 
. = cwd

```
cwd
 |- com
    |- durgasoft
        |- scjp
            |- Test.class

```

If the corresponding package structure not already available then then this command itself will create corresponding package structure


As destination instead of . we can take any valid directory name example -> javac -d F: Test.java

If the specifie directory not already available then we will get compile time error javac -d Z: Test.java If Z: not available then we will get compile time error saying Directory not found : Z:


At time of execution we have to use fully qualified name 
> java com.durgasoft.scjp.Test

O/p : package demo


Conclusion 1 : 

```java
package pack1; 
pacakge pack2;

public class A {
    public static void main(String[] args){

    }
}
```
```
CE : class, interface or enum expected
```
In any java file there can be only one java statement, otherwise we will get compile time error



Conclusion 2 : 

```java

import java.util.*;

package pack1;

public class A {

}

```


```
CE : class, interface or enum expected
```

In any java program the first non comment statement should be package statement if it is available otherwise we will get compile time error.







The following is valid java source file structure


```java

package statement; Atmost one

import statements ; Any number

class/interface/enum declaration ; Any number
```


Test.java (empty source file) (valid)

```


```
An empty source file is perfectly valid java program




Test.java (only package) (valid)

```
package pack1;

```




Test.java (only import) (valid)

```
import java.util.*;

```



Test.java (package and import) (valid)

```
package pack1;
import java.util.*;

```

Test.java (only class) (valid)
```
class Test {

}
```
