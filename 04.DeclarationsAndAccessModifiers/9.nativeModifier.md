**native modifier**


Native is a modifier applicable only for methods and we cannot apply anywhere else.

The methods which are implemented in non java (mostly C or C++ are called native methods or foreign methods)

The main objective of native keyword are 

- to improve performance of system
- to acheive machine level or memory level communication
- to use already existing legacy non java code


sudo code to use native keyword in java


class Native {

    // Load native libraries
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("native_library_patil");
    }
    // declare a native method
    public native void m1();
}

class Client {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        Native n = new Native ();
        n.m1(); // Invoke a native method
    }
}


For native methods implementation is already available in old languages like C or C++ and we are not responsible to provide implementation hence native method declaration ends with ;


> public native void m1();

> public native void m1(){}

```
CE : native methods cannot have a body
```


For native methods implementation is already available in old languages but for abstract methods implementation should not be available hence we cannt declare native method as abstract ie native abstract combination is illegal combination for methods.


For native methods - we cannot declare native method as strictfp because there is not gurantee that old languages follow IEEE754 standard hence native strictfp combination is illegal combination for methods


The main advantage of native keyword is performance will be improved but the main disadvantage of native keyword is it breaks platforma independent nature of java.
