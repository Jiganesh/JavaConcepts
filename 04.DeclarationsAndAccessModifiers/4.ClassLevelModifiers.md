Whenever we are writing our own classes we have to provide some information about our class to the JVM like whether this class can be accessible from anywhere or not, wether child class creation is possible or not, or object creation is possbile or not

We can specify this information by using appropriate modifiers

- public
- private
- default
- protected
- final
- abstract
- static
- synchronized
- native
- strictfp
- transient
- volatile



The only applicable modifiers for top level classes are public, <default>, final , abstract, strictfp but for innerclasses the applicable modifiers are public, <default>, final , abstract, strictfp, private, protected, static.



```
private class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("hello")
    }
}
```

```
CE : modifier private not allowed here
```




```
11. private class A{
12.
13.}
14.
15.static class B{
16.
17.}
18.
19.public static void main(String[] args){
20.  System.out.println("Hello");
21.}

```


Access specifiers vs Access modifiers


public, private, protected are considered as specifiers except these remaining are considered as modifiers but these rule is applicable for old languages like C++.

In Java all are considered as modifiers only there is no word like specifier
