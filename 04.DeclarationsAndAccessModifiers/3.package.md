packages

It is an encapsulation mechanism to group related class and interfaces into a single unit which is nothing but package 


Example1: All classes and interfaces are required for database operation are grouped into a single package which is nothing but java.sql package


Example2 : All classes and interfaces which are useful for file io operation are grouped into separate package which is nothing but java.io package.


The main advantages of package are 

- to resolve naming conflicts ie unique identification of our components
- it improves modularity of application
- it improves maintainablity of application
- it provide security for our components
