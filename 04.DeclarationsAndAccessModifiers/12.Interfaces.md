Introduction : 

Definition 1 : Any service requirement specification (SRS) is considered as interface. 

Example 1 : JDBC API acts as requirement specification to develop database driver. Database vendor is responsible to implement this JDBC API


JDBC API
|- Oracle Driver
|- MYSQL Driver
|- DBL Driver


Servlet API
|- Apache Tomcat Server
|- Oracle Weblogic Server
|- IBM Websphere Server


Servlet API acts as requirement specification to develop webserver. Webserver vendor is responsible to implement Servlet API.


Definition 2 : 

From client point of view an interface defines the set of services what he is expecting from service provider point of view an interface defines the set of services what he is offering hence any contract between client and service provider is considered as interface.

Example : Throught BANK ATM GUI screen the bank people are highlighting the set of services they are offering. the same GUI screen is showing the set of services which customer is expecting hence GUI screen acts as contract beteween customer and bank


```

customer   ----> BANK ATM GUI SCREEN <----------- Bank


                Mini Statement
                Banking
                Deposit

```


Inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declaring or not - hence interface is considered as 100% pure abstract class 


Summary Definition:

Any service requirement specification or any contract between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract class is nothing but interface.





**Interface declaration and Implementation**



```java

interface Interface {
    void m1();
    void m2();
}
```


```java

// (abstract - if not all definition) CE : ServiceProvider is not abstract and does not override abstract method m2

abstract class ServiceProvider implements Interface {

    // (always keep public ) CE : m1 in ServiceProvider cannot implement m1 in Interface; attempting to assign weaker access privilates ; Was public
    public void m1(){

     };
}
```


```java
class SubServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {

    public void m2(){

    };
};
```

Whenever we are implementing a interface for each and every method of that interface we have to provide implementation otherwise we have to declare class as abstract then next level child class is responsible to provide implementation.

Every interface method is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not hence whenever we are implementing an interface method compulsory we should declare as public otherwise we will get compile time error.



extends VS implements


A class can extend only one class at a time
A Interface can extend any number of interface simultaneously
> interface C extends A, B

A class can implement any number of interface simultaneously
> class A implements B, C

A class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously
> class A extends B implements C, D, E




Which of the following is valid


A class can extend any number of classes at a time (invalid)
A class can implement only one interface at at time (invalid)
A Interface can extend only one interface at at ime (invalid)
An Interface can implement any number of interface simulatenouly (invalid)
A class can extend another classs and can implement an interface but not both simultaneously (invalid)
None of the above



Consider the following expression - for whcih of the follwing possiblities of X and Y the above expression is valid
> X extends Y


Both X and Y should be classes
Both X and Y should be interfaces
Both X and Y can be either classes or interfaces (correct)
No restrictions



> X extends Y, Z

X, Y, Z should be interfaces


> X implement Y, Z

X should be class and Y, Z should be interface


> X extends Y implements Z

X , Y should be classes and Z should be interface


> X implements Y extends Z 
Invalid CE : because we have to take extends first followed by interface



**Interface Methods**

Every method present inside interface is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not.


```java

interface Interf{
    void m1();
}

```
Why it is public and abstract by default ?

public - to make this method available to every implementation class
abstract - implementation class is responsible to provide implementation


hence inside interface all this method declarations are equal 


void m1 ();
public void m1();
abstract void m1();
public abstract void m1();

as every interface method is  always abstract and public we cannot declare interface method with following modifiers : private, protected, static, final , synchronized, strictfp, native

Which of the following method declaration are allowed inside interface ?

public void m1(){}
private void m1();
protected void m1();
static void m1();
public abstract native void m1();
abstract public void m1();  (only valid)



**Interface Variables**

An interface can contain variable. Main purpose of interface variable is to define requirement level constants.

```java

interface Iterf {
    int x = 10;
}


```
Every interface variable is public static final whether we declare it or not ?

public - to make this variable available to eery implementation class

static - without existing object also implementation class can access this variable

final - If one implementation class changes value then remaining implementation class will be affected.
    to restrict this every interface variable is always final



Inside interface all this variable declarations are equal 


int x = 10;
public int x = 10;
static int x = 1;
final int x = 10;
public static int x = 10;
public final int x = 1;
static final int x = 10;
public static final int x = 10;

As every interface variable is public static final we cant declare with following modifiers private, protected, transient, volatile

For Interface Varioable compulsory we should perform initialization at time of declaration otherwise we will get compile time error as shown below 
```java

interface Interf{
    int x ;
}

```

CE : = expected

```java

interface Interf{
    int x ;
}

```
CE : illegal start of expression


Inside interface which of the following variable declaration are allowed ?

int x ;
private int x = 10;
protected int x = 19;
volatile int x = 10;
transient int x = 10;
public static int x =10; (only valid declaration)


Inside implementation class we can access interface variables but we cannot modify values.

```java

interface Interf {
    int x = 10;
}

```

```java

class Test implements Interf {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        x = 777; // Cannot assign value to final variable x;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```


```java

class Test implements Interf {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int x = 777; // local variable so the code works
        System.out.println(x); // 777
    }
}
```

**interface naming conflicts**


Case 1 : If two interface contains method with same signature and same return type then in implementation class we have to provide implementation for only one method (m1 in below example).


```java

interface Left {
    public void m1();
}

```

```java

interface Right{
    public void m1();
}

```

Case 2 :
