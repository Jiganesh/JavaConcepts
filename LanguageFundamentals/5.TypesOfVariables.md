**Types of Variables**


Division 1  :
int x = 10;

x is primitive variables 



Student s = new Student ();

s is reference variables

Based on type of value represented by variable all variables are divided into two types
1. primitive variables can be used to represent primitive values example int x = 10

2. reference variables can be used to refer objects
example Student s = new Student();



Division 2 :

Based on position of declaration and behaviour all variables are divided into three types
- Instance Variables
- Static Variables
- Local Variable

==Instance Variable== : If the value of a variable is varied from object to object such type of variables are called instance variables For every object a separate copy of instance variable will be created.

Instance Variable should be declared within the class directly but outside of any method, block or constructor.

Instance Variable will be created at the time of object creation and destroyed at the time of object destruction and hence the scope of instance variable is exactly same as scope of object 

Instance variables will be stored in heap memory as part of object.

```java

class Test{

    int x = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(x); // This will give CE below

        Test t = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t.x); // 10
    
    }

    public void method1 (){
        System.out.println(x); // 10
    }
}
```


```
CE: non-static variable x cannot be referenced from a static context
```

We can't access instance variables directly from static area but we can access by using object reference but we can access instance variable directly from instance area.


For Instance variable JVM will always provide default values and we are not required to perform initialization explicitly.


```java

class Test{

    int x ;
    double d;
    boolean b;
    String s;


    public static void main(String[] args){
        

        Test t = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t.x); // 0
        System.out.println(t.d); // 0.0
        System.out.println(t.b); // false
        System.out.println(t.s); // null
    }
}
```

Instance variables are also known as object level variables or attributes.




==Static Variables==

If the value of variable is not varied from object to object then it is not recommended to declare variable as instance variable - we have to declare such type of variables at class level by using class modifier.


In the case of instance variables for every object a separate copy will be created but in case of static variables a single copy will be created at class level and shared by every object of the class

static variables should be declared within the class directly but outside of any method or block or constructor.

Static variables will be created at the time of class loading and destroyed at time of class unloading hence scope of static variable is same as scope of that class file.


Start JVM
Create and Start Main Thread
Locate Test.class file
Load Test.class -> static variable creation
Execute main method
Unload Test.class  -> static variable destruction
Terminate main thread
Shutdown JVM

Static variables will be stored in method Area


```java

class Test {
    static int x = 10;
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Test t = new Test();

        System.out.println(t.x); //10
        System.out.println(Test.x); //10
        System.out.println(x); //10
    }
}
```
We can access static variables either by object reference or by class name but recommended to use class name. Within the same class it is not required to classname and used directly.

We can access static variables from instance and static areas.

```java

class Test {
    static int x = 10;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(x); //10
    }

    public void method1(){
        System.out.println(x); //10
    }
}
```


```java

class Test{

    static int x ;
    static double d;
    static boolean b;
    static String s;


    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        System.out.println(x); // 0
        System.out.println(d); // 0.0
        System.out.println(b); // false
        System.out.println(s); // null
    }
}
```


For static variables JVM will provide default values and we are not required to perform initialization explicitly


Static Variable are also known as Class level Variables or fields

```java
class Test {
    static int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    public static void main (String[] args){
        Test t1 = new Test ();
        t1.x = 888;
        t1.y = 999;

        Test t2 = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t2.x + "  " + t2.y) // Output :  888 20
    }
}
```

See how static variable did not stay 10 as t1.x changed it to 888 and static variable is one copy for all hence t2.x gave 888


**Local Varibles**

Sometime to meet temporary requirements of programmer, we can declare variables inside a method, block or constructor such type of variables are called local variables, stack variables, temporary variables or automatic variables


Local variables will be stored inside stack memory.

Local variables will be created while executing the block in which we declare it. Once a block execution completes local variable will be destroyed. Hence the scope of local variable is the block in which we declared it


```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0 ; j< 3; j++){
            i = i+j
        }
        System.out.println(i + "   " + j)
        
        /*
        CE : cannot find symbol 
            symbol : variable j 
            location : class Test
        */
    }
}
```




```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        
        try {
            int j = Integer.parseInt("ten");
        } catch (NumberFormatException e){
            j = 10;
             /*
                CE : cannot find symbol 
                    symbol : variable j 
                    location : class Test
            */
        }

        System.out.println(j);
        /*
            CE : cannot find symbol 
                symbol : variable j 
                location : class Test
        */
    }  
}
```

For local variables JVM wont provide default values compulsory we should perform initiazation explicitly before using that variable ie if we are not using then it is not required to perform initialization.



```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        
       int x ;
       System.out.println("Hello"); 
    }  
}
```

> Hello



```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        
       int x ;
       System.out.println(x); 
    }  
}
```

```
CE : variable x might not have been initialized
```


```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        
       int x ;
       if (args.length > 0){
            x = 10;
       }

       System.out.println(x);
    }  
}
```

```
CE : variable x might not have been initialized
```


```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        
       int x ;
       if (args.length > 0){
            x = 10;
       }else {
            x = 20;
       }

       System.out.println(x);
    }  
}
```
> Java Test A B enter -> 10

> Java Test enter -> 20

Note : It is not recommended to perform initialization for local variables inside logical blocks because there is no guarantee for the execution of these blocks always at runtime.

It is highly recommended to perform initialization for local variables at time of declaration atleast with default values

The only applicable modifier for local varible is final by mistake you are trying to apply any other modifier then we will get compile time error

```java

class Test {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        public int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        private int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        protected int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        static int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        transient int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        volatile int x = 10; // invalid CE : illegal start of expression
        final  int x = 10; //valid
    }
}
```

If we are not declaring with any modifier then by default it is default but this rule is applicable only for instance and static variables but not for local variables.

```java

class Test {


    int x = 10;
    static int y = 20;
    public static void main (String [] args){
        int z = 10;
    }
}
```

Conclusions

- For Instance and Static variables JVM will provide default values and we are not required to perform initialization explicitly but for local variables JVM wont provide default values compulsory we should perform initialization explicitly before using that variable.

- Instance and Static Variables can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously and hence these are not thread safe but in case of local variables for every thread a separate copy will be created and hence local variables are thread safe.

- Every variable in java should be either primitive or reference hence various possible combinations of variables in java are

- instance primitive
- instance reference
- static primitive
- static reference
- local primitie
- local reference

```java

class Test {
    int x = 10; // instance-primitive
    static int y = 20; //static-reference

    public static void main (String [] args){
        int z = 10; //local-reference
    }
}
```


**Uninitialized Arrays**

1. Instance Level 

```java

class Test {

    int [] x ; 
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        Test t = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t.x); // null
        System.out.println(t.x[0]); // RE : NullPointerException

    }
}

```


```java

class Test {

    int [] x = new int[3]; 
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        Test t = new Test ();
        System.out.println(t.x); // [I@1244f12
        System.out.println(t.x[0]); // 0

    }
}

```


2. Static Level


```java

class Test {

    static int [] x ; 
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        System.out.println(x); // null
        System.out.println(x[0]); // RE : NullPointerException

    }
}

```


```java

class Test {

    static int [] x = new int[3]; 
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        System.out.println(x); // [I@1244f12
        System.out.println(x[0]); // 0

    }
}

```


3. Local Level

```java

class Test {

    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int [] x ; 

        System.out.println(x); // CE: Variable x might not have been initialized
        System.out.println(x[0]); // CE: Variable x might not have been initialized

    }
}

```


```java

class Test {

    public static void main (String[] args) {

        int [] x  = new int[3]; 

        System.out.println(x); // [I@1244f12
        System.out.println(x[0]); // 0

    }
}

```

Once we create an array every array element by default initialized with default values irrespective of whether it is instance static or local array
