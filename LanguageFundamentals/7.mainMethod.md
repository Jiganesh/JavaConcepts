Whether class contains main method or not and whether main method is declared according to requirement or not these things wont be checked by compiler. At runtime JVM is responsible to check these things. If JVM unable to find main method then we will get runtime exception saying No such method error main.


```java

class Test {

}
```

Runtime Exception:

```
ERROR!
Error: Main method not found in class Test, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```
